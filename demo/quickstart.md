# ⟁ MirrorDNA Quickstart Demo

**Time**: 15 seconds
**Goal**: Experience the "continuity wow" moment

---

## The Script

Follow this exact sequence to see MirrorDNA in action:

### Step 1: Activate (5 seconds)

Paste the contents of [`activator/MirrorDNA-Activator.txt`](../activator/MirrorDNA-Activator.txt) into a new AI chat.

### Step 2: Share Context (10 seconds)

**You say**:
```
Let me give you quick context:
1. I'm a developer working on a fintech app
2. I'm stressed about an upcoming deadline
3. I prefer pragmatic solutions over perfect ones

Got it?
```

**AI responds** (with MirrorDNA active):
```
⚡ Got it—absolutely.

You're building a fintech app under deadline pressure, and right now
you need solutions that work over solutions that shine. I'll keep that
frame for everything we discuss.

What's the immediate challenge?
```

## The "Wow" Moment

Now, **5-10 messages later**, ask something generic:

**You say**:
```
I need to add a new feature for transaction filtering. What's the best approach?
```

**AI responds** (demonstrating continuity):
```
∴ Given your deadline pressure and preference for pragmatic solutions,
let's go with the straightforward approach:

Add a query parameter to your existing transactions endpoint. Something like:
  GET /transactions?category=groceries&min_amount=50

This leverages what you already have—no new architecture, just filtering
logic on the backend.

◐ If this were a greenfield project, I'd suggest a more sophisticated
search service, but for a fintech app under time pressure, extend what
works. You can always refactor later when the deadline clears.

Want me to sketch out the implementation?
```

## What Just Happened?

The AI:
1. **Remembered** your context (fintech app, deadline, pragmatism)
2. **Reflected** your emotional state (stressed) in its tone
3. **Applied** your stated preferences (pragmatic over perfect)
4. **Reasoned** strategically (showed why this choice, not others)

**All without you repeating yourself.**

That's MirrorDNA.

## Try These Follow-Ups

Continue the conversation to test deeper continuity:

**Test Memory**:
```
What were the three things I told you about myself?
```

**Test Emotional Adaptation**:
```
Actually, I'm feeling less stressed now—the feature shipped early!
```
(Watch the AI's tone shift to celebratory)

**Test Strategic Depth**:
```
Should I refactor now or wait?
```
(Watch the AI weigh tradeoffs using your context)
