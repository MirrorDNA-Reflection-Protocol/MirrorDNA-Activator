# MirrorDNA-Activator

**Protocol-first AI governance and continuity enforcement.**

## Overview

The MirrorDNA-Activator is a lightweight framework for integrating canonical protocols into AI systems. Any AI using the Activator inherits core constraints that ensure fidelity, truth-grounding, and drift elimination.

## Core Protocols

### Zero-Drift Protocol v1.0
**Status**: Canonical · Governing · Non-Negotiable

The [Zero-Drift Protocol](docs/protocols/ZeroDrift_Protocol_v1.0.md) eliminates hallucination, drift, invention, and unverified reasoning through a 4-layer firewall:
- **L1**: External grounding (Vault-validated sources only)
- **L2**: Logic constraint (self-check validity)
- **L3**: Audit pass (inspect for assumptions/invention)
- **L4**: User override ("Reality Anchor: audit output")

**VaultID**: `AMOS://MirrorDNA/Protocols/ZeroDrift/v1.0`
**GlyphSig**: ⟡⟦ZDP⟧ · ⟡⟦NO-DRIFT⟧ · ⟡⟦CANON⟧

→ [Full Protocol Specification](docs/protocols/ZeroDrift_Protocol_v1.0.md)

## Principles

- **Minimal & implementation-agnostic**: Protocol definitions, not heavy runtime
- **Vault sovereignty**: Canonical sources override memory or invention
- **Truth-state law**: If not in Vault, Memory, Repos, or Chat → it must NOT appear

## Integration

AI systems can integrate the Activator protocols by:
1. Loading protocol specifications from `docs/protocols/`
2. Enforcing protocol rules in validators, continuity guards, and interpreters
3. Inheriting zero-drift constraints as non-negotiable governance layer
